# Unclosed Parenthesis Bug in Python

This repository demonstrates a common, yet easily overlooked, error in Python: an unclosed parenthesis in a function definition.  The bug is subtle and can lead to unexpected behavior or SyntaxErrors.  The solution highlights a simple way to identify and fix this issue.

## Bug Description
The `unclosed_paren_bug.py` file contains a function definition with an unclosed parenthesis, resulting in a syntax error.  This kind of error can be difficult to spot, especially in longer functions or when dealing with nested parentheses.

## Solution
The `unclosed_paren_solution.py` file provides the corrected code.  By simply adding the missing closing parenthesis, the syntax error is resolved, and the function will work as expected.
